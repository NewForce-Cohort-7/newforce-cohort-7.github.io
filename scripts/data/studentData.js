    At NewForce, I have learned hands-on experiences on amazing technologies which allows me to create a website platform from scratch and input data in it! But also, connecting such platform to the right user or even taking it a few steps back - understanding what the user wants and which design/technologies suites them the best piques my interest.
    Working with data and using it in real world applications is also an important and exciting field. We can have the greatest software application but without the correct and analyzed data, our application may not be the most useful! This is why I have applied and currently work as an Implementation Analyst, to learn more the process of data collection and implementation.
    I like to see each software or web based app from the eyes of the user. How will they interact with it? How is it going to make their time spent with the app the most efficient/exciting? and most importantly, how is it solving the problem and is the solution future proof?`,
